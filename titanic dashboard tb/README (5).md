# TITANIC DATASET 

### Tableau dashboard





Introduction:
This project is a Tableau dashboard that visualizes data from the Titanic dataset, which contains information on the passengers aboard the Titanic. The dataset was sourced from Kaggle 


The Titanic dataset contains the following columns:

PassengerId: Unique identifier for the passenger
Survived: Whether the passenger survived (0 = no, 1 = yes)
Pclass: Passenger class (1 = first class, 2 = second class, 3 = third class)
Name: Passenger name
Sex: Passenger gender (male or female)
Age: Passenger age
SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic
Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic
Ticket: Ticket number
Fare: Passenger fare
Cabin: Cabin number
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)



Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of Tableau in visualizing a real-world dataset. I explored the Titanic dataset and answered several questions through visualizations, such as analyzing the distribution of passenger demographics and survival rates, and identifying the factors most strongly associated with survival. Through the Tableau dashboard,  I gained insights into the tragic sinking of the Titanic and the factors that influenced passenger survival.
